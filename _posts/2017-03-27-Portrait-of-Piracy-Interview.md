1. How did you get into pirating material, why didn't simply buy, either through itunes, or a streaming service? I got into it because im a lazy, cheap son of a bitch. Why should I pay for something when i can get it for free? Lets say I like 200 songs, I would be paying a 1.29 each which is 258 dollars. Im not made of money and i    could use that money to do other things.
2. What is the major type of material that you pirate? (music, movies, textbooks, etc.) I mainly pirate Music and movies but every once and awhile ill pirate textbooks. Its ridculous to pay so much for a text book when my teachers only use one paragraph on one page in the entire book.
3. Have you ever had any profound experiences with pirated any type of material? Ive never had a bad experience and Ive always gotten what ive wanted without and       probelms or complications.
4. What benefits have you personally enjoyed as a result of piracy of any kind? I get a ton of free shit and it takes about as long as buying the pirated material.It doesnt save me time but it defeintely saves me money.
5. As someone who has benefited from Internet piracy, if you were to talk with someone who is anti-piracy about the issue, what your main point be to back up your stance? Why do companies charge so much? $60 bucks for a dvd you can get online? You can watch it once and not pay whereas with a dvd you will watch it once and then have a dvd you arent willing to use.
6. What do you believe to be the major arguments of the other side of this issue, those who are anti-piracy? That Piracy cost companies money and hurts the business which is true but I dont care about those companies. For every one person who pirates the product at least ten would buy the same product.
7. Do you believe that piracy should be legal, or that the punishments should simply be relaxed? I think the punishemnts should be relaxed because its stupid to go to prison for pirating some music.
8. Have you, or someone who know, ever been a victim of piracy of any kind (music, movie, textbooks, etc.)? I dont know people. Who do you think I am? Joe Biden
9. Do you ever feel any sympathy towards the artists whose music you are taking for free? What?!?!?!?!? why would I have any sympath for some millionare making millions off music? Most music artists these days hardly produce their own music by themselves so why should I pay them for music that probably isnt allthat original.
10. Do you belive that there can every be any resoltion, maybe a compromise between the two sides, or will there always be a struggle between the artists and the pirates? There will always be a struggle because nobody wants to pay for a product regardless of the price no matter how miniscule or large the price is.
