Internet piracy is a major issue that, one way or another, is a part of the lives of billions of people around the world. Whether is be as someone pirating material, or those who have their own work pirated, or a concerned citizen, it seems like everyone has an opinion on the subject. The nature of piracy itself also makes it more difficult to quantify the exact economic impact of piracy. This is because while it is possible to accurately approximate how much material is pirated, the monetary impact is disputed, for many argue that many of the those downloads wouldn't happen if the person had to pay for the product, and the company/artist is therefore not actually losing that money. To get an idea of one side of this debate, I interviewed a friend who pirates is good amount, and is very much on the side of pro-piracy.

The first Question I asked my friend, we'll call him Jim, was how he got into pirating rather than buying material. As a college student he said that a lot of it was the money, for he didn't have the ability to the spend excessive amounts of money, his full library would cost $258, on something such as music when their are more important, and necessary things that need to be bought. This is definitely something that can get overlooked, I think that sometimes artists lost sight of their fans, and their fans ability to actually be able to listen to the music that the artists produce. My next question was another simple one, just asked him what material he most often pirated. Jim told me that for the most part he pirated music, and every so often a movie, or a textbook for a class if it happens to be excessively expensive. A common narrative for those who pirate music are the issue that they encounter as a result, but when I asked Jim if he had ever encountered any issues, he said he'd never had none. Never gotten any viruses, poor quality material, or thousand dollar fines in the mail. My next question for Jim was about the benefits that he enjoyed as a result of piracy. Along with the obvious benefit of free stuff he also mentioned how many artists he has discovered. He went on to say that a lot of the artists that he listens to he only knows about because he able to freely listen to new music without risk of wasting his money. This is something that I definitely believe to be overlooked in the debate of piracy. Many people don't take into account the number of people who never would have heard of a certain artist if not for piracy, and while the artist might not make any money off the download of their music, they could vary well offset that cost if the listener then attends a concert or other event the artist is performing at. This is something that Derek Webb, a small-time musician, argues for in his blog post "Giving it Away: How Free Music Makes More Than Sense", as he gives all his music away for free, saying that he makes that money back when those people who hear his music go to his appearances. I next asked Jim how he would back up his stance on Internet piracy in a debate. Jim argued that the material costs too much. He believes that paying for something that could easily be produced for less, and may not even be used that much, shouldn't cost as much as it does. I next presented Jim with statistic showing how much piracy, software piracy specifically, hurts companies. In 2008 it would found that companies lost $10.4 billion to piracy. His response to this stat was essentially "who cares?". He said that those companies can afford to t lose the money, and that most of the money that they are losing is to people who can't afford their software anyway. I next questioned him on his thoughts about the punishment for piracy. I believe this to be a major flaw in his argument so far, for not every company is Microsoft, and can afford to have their products pirated with almost no substantial effect. Many of these are small companies that need the revenue from their software. Jim told me that he believed the punishments to be far too strict, for the fines can be insane, and it's a ridiculous thing to go to jail for. I then asked him if anyone he ever knew was negatively affected by piracy, either as a musician or as someone who received a harsh penalty. He humorously responded "I don't know people. Who do you think I am? Joe Biden?". After a pretty mellow interview to this point, I poked the bear with my next question, asking him whether he felt any sympathy towards the artists whose material he is pirating. Jim went off. Beside himself he exclaimed "What?!?!", seemingly offended by my question. Not only saying that the millionaire musicians that he pirates from don't need the extra money, but also that many musicians don't even fully write their own songs to begin with. I ended the interview by asking him about his view on the future of the issue, whether believed that there would ever be a resolution, or if there will always be a constant struggle between the artists and the pirates. According to Jim the struggle with always exist. There is no way to resolve this polarizing issue.

Piracy is a debate that many people have been affecting by, and as a result many people have opinions on. And when this is the case it not only causes for some ugly debates, and a hot button topic, but also becomes a seed for ignorance. One thing that I have taken from this interview is that many people seem to be so ingrained in their beliefs that they are unable to see the other side of the argument and any good points that they may to make. Our interviewee, was clearly very out of touch, and angry toward the musicians side of the arguments and the things that they had to say. This seems to go the other way as well, as you rarely head about the college students and others who may not be able to listen to the music that they do if not for piracy. Piracy is a major issue in our 21st century world, and it seems to be that that won't be changing anytime soon.

Q: How did you get into pirating material, why didn't you simply buy, either through itunes, or a streaming service?

A: I got into it because I'm a lazy, cheap son of a b----. Why should I pay for something when I can get it for free? Lets say I like 200 songs, I would be paying a 1.29 each which is 258 dollars. I don't have the kind of money to spend on music, I need to use that money to do other things.

Q: What is the major type of material that you pirate? (music, movies, textbooks, etc.)?

A: I mainly pirate Music and movies but every once and awhile I'll pirate textbooks. Its ridiculous to pay so much for a text book when my teachers only use one paragraph on one page in the entire book.

Q: Have you ever had any profound experiences with pirated any type of material?

A: I've never had a bad experience and Ive always gotten what I've wanted without and problems or complications.

Q: What benefits have you personally enjoyed as a result of piracy of any kind?

A: I get a ton of free shit and it takes about as long as buying the pirated material. I've also been able to greatly expand the artists I listen to, since I don't have to pay for the music, I can afford to listen to music I'm not sure I'll like, then just delete it if I don't like it. I've discovered a lot of new artists cause of this. It doesn't save me time but it definitely saves me money.

Q: As someone who has benefited from Internet piracy, if you were to talk with someone who is anti-piracy about the issue, what your main point be to back up your stance?

A: Why do companies charge so much? $60 bucks for a dvd you can get online? You can watch it once and not pay whereas with a dvd you will watch it once and then have a dvd you aren't willing to use.

Q: In the Sixth Annual BSA-IDC Global Software Piracy Study (2009) it was found that in North American alone (the region with the lowest rate of piracy) software piracy alone cost companies $10.4 billion. Does that fact change how you think about piracy at all?

A: It's true that piracy costs companies money and hurts the business, but I don't care about those companies. For every one person who pirates the product at least ten would buy the same product, it's not like these huge companies can't afford to lose a little money, plus, most of that money that they are losing is to people who can't afford their product to begin with.

Q: Do you believe that piracy should be legal, or that the punishments should simply be relaxed?

A: I think the punishments should be relaxed because its stupid to go to prison for pirating some music.

Q: Have you, or someone who know, ever been a victim of piracy of any kind (music, movie, textbooks, etc.)?

A: I don't know people. Who do you think I am? Joe Biden?

Q: Do you ever feel any sympathy towards the artists whose music you are taking for free?

A: What?!?!?!?!? Why would I have any sympathy for some millionaire making millions off music? Most music artists these days hardly produce their own music by themselves so why should I pay them for music that probably isn't all that original.

Q: Do you believe that there can every be any resolution, maybe a compromise between the two sides, or will there always be a struggle between the artists and the pirates?

A: There will always be a struggle because nobody wants to pay for a product regardless of the price no matter how minuscule or large the price is.
