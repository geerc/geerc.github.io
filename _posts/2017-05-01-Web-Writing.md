The advantages of web writing very easy to see. For one, you work is easily accessible from anywhere you go. As long as you have an Internet connection you can access you work from anywhere. This prevents you from having to carry around and keep track of a USB drive that can easily by lost or broken. This is major advantage, as simply getting your work out there can be the most important thing. Using GitHub and Reveal.js for presentations can also be helpful for the same reasons, as the presentation can more easily be accessed by you, and others wishing to view your work.

While there are certainly advantages there are also disadvantages. One of which is also an advantage; the fact that your work suddenly become available for all the world to see. If you write and publish an article to the web there can be all kinds of unexpected responses from people whom you've never met. As far as GitHub and Reveal.js go for presentations, the disadvantages are plenty. Compared to a service such as Power point, GitHub and Reveal.js are significantly more technologically advanced, and require a much steeper learning curve. This can drive many people away, as they can much more easily create a presentation that is just as aesthetically appealing, but with far less work involved.
