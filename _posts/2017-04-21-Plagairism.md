#### TL;DR: By making college student's available to those other than the professor, colleges can decrease the prevalence of plagiarism on campus.

While almost everyone can agree that plagiarism is a major issue, and a growing one at that, there are few people in the process of orchestrating a revolutionary solution. Almost every college, high school, workplace, etc. attacks plagiarism from one of two front; relying on either morality or fear of punishment to deter plagiarism. From the moral side we see colleges implementing honor codes, and thus relying on the good morals of the students to themselves curb plagiarism. The other popular method is to write up regulations about plagiarism, accordingly punishing those who break these rules. While both of these approaches may seem logical, neither one is perfect, rather they are far from it.

When colleges attempt to stifle plagiarism, and cheating in general, with the implementation of an honor code, they do so hoping the that the morality of the student population will keep plagiarism at bay. While there may be a large majority of the campus that abides by the honor code, this does not mean that the honor code is any more efficient than traditional sets of rules, as there are many  issues that work against the honor code. In her article "Academic Integrity and Student Plagiarism", Susan D. Blum mentions student solidarity as one of these issues. This becomes an issue because many honor codes rely on the student population to police itself, but not everyone is willing to call someone else out, even fewer when that someone is a friend, on an infraction of the honor code. This creates a major problem for the effectiveness of honor codes on college campuses, and it's a problem that cannot be easily addressed.

The second approach to dealing with plagiarism is to write up and strictly enforce a set of rules or regulations. This approach seems the make the most sense on paper, as you would think that will harsh enough punishments students would tend to shy away from plagiarism, but unfortunately the situation rarely plays out as such. This reason for this is fairly simple and in fact common. Take for example the fact that in the U.S. it is illegal for someone to drink if they are under the age of 21. Despite this it is very common, almost the expectation, for high school and college students to drink in at least some capacity before the age of 21. One reason for this, and this is especially prevalent in college, is that while the consequences are harsh, very few people actually believe there to be a high risk of getting caught and having to face those consequences. This is the same reason that setting regulations about plagiarism don't work to prevent plagiarism, for the students, whether or not they are right, do not perceive there to be a very high risk of them getting caught plagiarizing.
