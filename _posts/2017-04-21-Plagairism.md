#### TL;DR:

While almost everyone that you talk to would agree that plagiarism is a major issue, and a growing one at that, very few people would be able to say that they, or someone that they know, is in the process of orchestrating a revolutionary solution. Almost every college, high school, workplace, etc. uses the same approach to dealing with those who plagiarize. Almost everywhere that you go will approach the punishment of plagiarism from either a moral or criminal standard. From the moral side we see colleges implementing honor codes, and thus relying on the good morals of the students to curb plagiarism. The other popular method is to write up regulations about plagiarism, and treat them essentially as the law of the land, accordingly punishing those who break that law. While both of these approaches may seem logical, neither one is perfect, rather both are far from it.

When colleges attempt to stifle plagiarism, and cheating in general, with the implementation of an honor code, they do so hoping the that the morality of the student population will keep plagiarism at bay. While there may be a large majority of the campus that abides by the honor code, this does not mean that the honor code is any more efficient than traditional sets of rules, but there are many other issues that work against the honor code. In her article "Academic Integrity and Student Plagiarism", Susan D. Blum mentions student solidarity as one of these issues. This becomes an issue because many honor codes rely on the student population to police itself, but not everyone would be willing to call someone else out, even fewer someone they consider a friend, on an infraction of the honor code. This creates a major problem for the effectiveness of honor codes on college campuses, and it's a problem that cannot be easily addressed.
