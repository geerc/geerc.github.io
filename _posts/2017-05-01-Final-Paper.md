In 1942 Austrian Economist Joseph Schumpeter coined the phrase 'creative destruction'. He used this term to refer to the process in which new technology leads to the downfall of industries that had relied on the now outdated technology. Examples of this are everywhere throughout history: the horse and buggy, textile mills, elevator operators, film producers, etc. While the loss of each of these industries resulted in many people losing their jobs, it often leads to the creation many new ones. When the automobile was first introduced, companies needed workers to staff the factories. As they became more popular, people were needed to build roads and bridges that would be more suitable for cars to drive on. This process is never ending, and if we look around right now, it becomes obvious that creative destruction is always at work. A couple of the most obvious examples in the world right now are the failing of bookstores and coal mines.

With the advent of e-readers, book store sales have begun to plummet, as can be seen in the below graph from the US census bureau. After increasing each year since at least 1992, U.S. book store sales peeked in 2007 at $17.7 million dollars (US Census Bureau), and have since declined each year through 2015.

E-readers are putting bookstores like Borders, which went bankrupt in 2011, out of business, and at the helm of this technological transition is one company with almost complete control over the market: Amazon. As of October of 2015 Amazon's market share of e-book unit sales was 74%. Apple and Barnes in Noble were second and third with 11% and 8% respectively (Author Earnings).

Amazon owns the ebook market, but there is one category where Amazon can't compete with bookstores: job creation. For every $10 million in revenue that Amazon brings in they employ 14 workers, but for brick-and-mortar stores, the average is 47 (Bercovici). So while Amazon is revolutionizing how people buy and read books, it comes at the cost of bookstores, and the jobs that they create; however, Amazon is the exception to the resulting job markets from creative destruction. Something that can be clearly seen by investigating the coal industry.

Throughout the campaign trail of the 2016 election, one of Donald Trumps favorite talking points was about how he was going to bring back the coal jobs. In essence, he wanted to stop, and reverse, the process of creative destruction. In the last decade or so the push for renewable energy has continue to grow, and as the technology advances and becomes more affordable and efficient, coal will become increasingly obsolete; something it doesn't take a genius to recognize. This is because since 1985 the number of employees in the coal mining industry has for the most part continued to decrease through 2017 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), regressing from its peak of 178.3 thousand in April of 1985, to a measly 50.3 thousand in March of 2017.

This loss of 128,000 jobs is certainly something to be concerned about until further detail are explored. Details such as the fact that in 2015 there were 769 thousand jobs in renewable energy in the U.S. (International Renewable Energy Agency), approximately 4 times as many than the most amount of jobs the coal industry has provided in the last 30 odd years. In this case the process of creative destruction not only brought us incredible technology that could help extend the life of the planet, but also created millions of jobs at the same time.

There is no way to stop or to reverse creative destruction, and there is no reason that we should want to. The advancement of technology is integral to our future, and there should be no reason that one should wish to stand in the way of it. In an example such as the decline of the coal industry, along with incredible new technology, many new industries have emerged, and thus leading to hundreds of thousands of new jobs, with more on the way.
