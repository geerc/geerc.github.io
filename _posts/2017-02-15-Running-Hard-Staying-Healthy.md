TL;DR: Many common running injures can be treated rather easily, and all that is necessary to learn these treatments is access to the Internet.

All runners of all levels experience those little aches and pains that are part of the sport, however; there are many different ways that people deal with these pains. Some people take the time out of their day to go see a doctor, some rest for a few days and hope it goes away, some try to simply run through it until they can't anymore -- and while these are all options, I believe that there is a better alternative out there, the Internet. Through the years I have found the often the best way to deal with those annoying aches and pains is to research the symptoms, and treatments on the Internet.

Let me just start off my saying the Internet is no alternative to a medical professional when it comes to major injuries, be them related to running or not, but as far as the minor annoyances that are common ground for runners go, the Internet can be an incredible source. Along with medical websites such as webmd.com, there are countless websites devoted specifically for running, such as runnersworld.com that can be very useful when researching an injury. When using the Internet to self-diagnose yourself there are a few things to keep in mind. First off, make sure you are as specific as possible about the location of the pain in order to get results that will be the most useful for you. For example, if your shins have been hurting during runs, don’t search ‘leg pain’, for the results will not be specific to the problem area. Something else that is important is to make sure the articles you visit are referring to the issue that you are experiencing, instead of skipping to the suggestions for treatment. Many times there are multiple different issues that can arise around the same area, but require very different treatments.

To prove that this can be a very useful strategy for dealing with common running injuries, I will use an example of how I was able to make use of the Internet to treat my own injury. During this past summer, I began to have some shin pains, things that I had felt before but ignored, but decided that I was going to do something about this issue once and for all. I got on the computer and began researching the pain and found that they were shin splints, a very common, and easy to treat, injury among runners. As I continued my research I was able to found that the best way to treat shin splints is to ice, rest, and to stretch/strengthen the calf muscles, for weak calves forces muscles in your shins to work harder, causing the shin splints. After a couple weeks of cross training, icing, and strengthening, I was back running at full strength.

With the help of the Internet runners of all levels can now easily diagnose and treat common running injuries without having to spend the time and money to go see a doctor.
