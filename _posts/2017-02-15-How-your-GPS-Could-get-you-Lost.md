As the use of smart phones as increased over the last decade so too has the use of GPS apps such as Google Maps, Waze, or MapQuest. No longer are the days of scanning over the huge state road map to find your next turn, or exit, for now we have step-by-step instructions for how to get from point A to point B the most efficient way possible, but does it come at a price? Does relying on simple step-by-step instructions reduce our ability to navigate our surroundings on our own? The simple answer is yes, but why?

As we have become more reliant on step-by-step instructions from a GPS, we have subsequently become less reliable on using our brain's own ability to navigate by itself. Prior to the widespread use of GPS our brains would essentially make a mental map of our surroundings, remembering landmarks along the way. This is called spatial navigation and was how humanity had always navigated its surroundings, but GPS changed all that. When people navigate with GPS they tend not to pay attention to their surroundings, for they are mindlessly following instructions from the GPS. Because of this we don't remember as much, if anything, about the surroundings of the trip that they just took. This inability to navigate with the use of GPS can effect people everyday with our driving, for if someone only knows the route the tye repeat day in and day out, they will have less room to be flexible if they encounter something like construction work, or an accident. While being unable to swiftly avoid traffic may be annoying, if is far from the most important effect of relying on a GPS.
