subtitle: Everything there is to know about me

TL;DR: I am from Jenkintown, PA and am currently a freshman at Allegheny College with interessts in Economics and Computer Science, who is also on the Varsity Cross Country and Track teams.

I was born and raised in Jenkintown, PA, a tiny suburb just outside of Philadelphia, and attended Jenkintown Elementary, Middle, and High Schools. In my youth I spent most of my time participating in many different sports. Among these were baseball, soccer, basketball, skiing, football, along with others that were simply created by my friends and I. During my years at Jenkintown I was deeply involved in athletics, earning numerous accolades in Cross Country, Baseball, and Track, as well as serving on the Athletic Advisory Committee. Other organizations that I was a part of include National Honor Society and World Language Honor Society.

I am now a freshman at Allegheny College in Meadville, PA, and am on the Varsity Cross Country and Track teams. I have yet to declare a major and minor, but have great interest in both Computer Science and Economics, and plan on combing the two. At Allegheny I have taken two introductory Economics classes (Intro to Microeconomics and Intro to Macroeconomics) and also two introductory Computer Science classes (Computer Science 111 and Computer Science 112), and this interest in Computer Science prompted me to enroll is the FS102 course Software everywhere, in which I have developed this website containing my work from Allegheny.

My future plans are, at the moment, basically nonexistent. Looking very far down the road I would most likely like to be able to work my way up to a management position, but what I will be doing after college is to be determined. For now I am focusing on declaring a major and minor, which very well may change how my career path plays out. Some other courses that I look forward to possibly taking in the future at Allegheny are Introduction to Managerial Economics and Advanced Managerial Economics. These course interest me because, as mentioned before, my long term hope to be able to rise up to a Managerial role at a company.
