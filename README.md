This repository contains the source code for the web site of Christian Geer, a student at Allegheny College. This site was created with the help of the Beautiful Jekyll template which can be found on git hub. If you wish to use this website as starting point for your own use, read the following instructions.

###1. Configuring GitHub

First you must create a GitHub, if you already have one you may skip this step. To create an account simply go to github.com and click on the green 'Sign Up' button.
 
### 1. Fork this repository

You can fork this repository by clicking the 'Fork' button on the top right corner. Forking means that you now copied this whole project and all the files into your account.

### 2. Rename the repository to `<yourusername>.github.io`

Renaming the respository will create a GitHub User page that will be available at `http://<yourusername>.github.io` within a couple minutes.  To do this, click on 'Settings' at the top and there you'll have an option to rename.

### 3. Customize your website settings

Edit the `_config.yml` file to change all the settings to reflect your site. To edit the file, click on it and then click on the pencil icon (watch the video tutorial above if you're confused).  The settings in the file are fairly self-explanatory and I added comments inside the file to help you further. Any line that begins with a pound sign (`#`) is a comment, and the rest of the lines are actual settings.
